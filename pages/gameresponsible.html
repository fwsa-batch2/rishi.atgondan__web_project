    <h1 class="main_heading">Why Game Responsibly?</h1>

    <p class="para"> We know you love hot-dropping into Erangel, acing those headshots or maybe spending hours trying to
        improve that finish count, but when you play for hours, you hardly find time to look up at the world.

        We are here to remind you that the real world is equally exciting too. We at Battlegrounds Mobile India, share
        the same passion for gaming as you.

        At the same time we urge you to look-up every now and then from your game as well. Enjoy our games in
        moderation, maintain a healthy game-life balance and spend quality time in the real world.
    </p>

    <p class="para_2">P.S. If you’re stuck on the other end, here’s how you can get your friends to look up</p>

    <p class="para">
        Always remember,<br>
        <br>
        TREAT GAMING AS A FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT AND DON’T LET IT OVERPOWER YOUR LIFE. GAME RESPONSIBLY.
    </p>

    <p class="para_2">As a parent, we must know the time your wondering why your child spending so muc time with their
        phone.<br>What games are the playing? who are the talking to?</p>

    <p class="para_2">When we launched Battlegrounds Mobile India, we truly believed that creating a culture of
        responsible gaming was our responsibility too.<br>
        So, here’s what we did about it.</p>

    <hr class="hr">

    <p>
    <h1 class="heading">VIRTUAL WORLD WARNING MESSAGE</h1>

    <p class="points">Just before the game starts, we have made sure that our players are aware of the virtual world
        they are entering.<br>
        The in-game audio reinforces that this game exists in a virtual world and is not their real life.</p>

    <h1 class="heading">OTP AUTHENTICATION</h1>

    <p class="points">Every player, below the age of 18, needs to register a parent or a guardian before they start play
        for the first time. An OTP will be sent to the registered person’s number,<br>
        post which the child is allowed to play the game.<br></p>

    <h1 class="heading">BREAKTIME REMINDERS</h1>

    <p class="points">Some games can get intense and make players lose track of time. But with our timely breaktime
        reminders, we have made sure that our players get the required downtime.<br>
        These reminders help them look up from their game and get back to real life, maintaining a healthy game-life
        balance.<br></p>

    <h1 class="heading">GAMEPLAY LIMITS</h1>

    <p class="points">With a strict gameplay limit in place, we have made sure that players below 18 years do not
        indulge in gaming for more than 3 hours per day.<br>
        This automatically helps them treat gaming as an activity performed in moderation.<br></p>

    <h1 class="heading">DAILY SPEND LIMITS</h1>

    <p class="points">We have also set an in-game daily spend limit of Rs. 7000 that automatically stops them from
        overspending and overgaming.<br></p>

    <h1 class="heading">MODERATED GAME GRAPHICS</h1>

    <p class="points">We have sensitised in-game graphics to inculcate a healthy and responsible gaming culture. We have
        reduced violence, nudity, bloodshed and set parameters that keep the language in check</p>

    <p class="para_2">This is just a start. There is a long way to go but with your continued support, we are sure to
        grow the love for gaming in every household.</p>

    <hr class="hr">

    <h1 class="main_heading">INDIA, LET'S BATTLE THIS TOGETHER!</h1>

    <p class="points">As a country in awe of gaming, we at Krafton salute your passion.<br>
        However, we want you to show the same passion for responsible gaming as well.</p>

    <img id="video3" class="bottom_img" src="../assets/images/game_responsibly_imgjpg">

    <p class="points">
        Always remember, Battlegrounds Mobile India is meant for your entertainment.<br>
        So keep it light and have fun!
